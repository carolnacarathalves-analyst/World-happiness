# World Happiness Report â€“ EDA and Visualization (2015â€“2019)

This project is my **Google Data Analytics Capstone**, completed in December 2022, as part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) on Coursera.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the World Happiness Report data (2015â€“2019) to understand:
- How happiness scores vary across countries and over time
- Which socio-economic factors are most correlated with happiness
- The extent to which each factor influences overall happiness scores

The analysis includes both **Python EDA** and a **Tableau dashboard** for interactive exploration.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
Data source: [World Happiness Report â€“ Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)  
The dataset contains annual happiness scores and six contributing factors for over 150 countries:
1. **GDP per capita**
2. **Social and family support**
3. **Health and life expectancy**
4. **Freedom to make life choices**
5. **Generosity**
6. **Trust in government / Perception of corruption**

Each country's scores are compared to *Dystopia* â€” a hypothetical country representing the lowest possible averages â€” serving as a regression benchmark.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) â€“ data cleaning, analysis, and static visualizations
- **Tableau Public** â€“ interactive data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ workflow and documentation

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Nordic countries consistently rank highest in happiness scores
- GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy have the strongest correlation with happiness
- Generosity and perceived corruption vary widely across regions, with a weaker correlation to happiness scores
